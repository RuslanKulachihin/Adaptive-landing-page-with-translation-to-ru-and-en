# Adaptive-landing-page-with-translation-to-ru-and-en
This is a regular adaptive landing page written in pure html, css and JavaScript. This page has an automatic translation into Russian and English, as well as an adaptive menu for mobile and tablet versions.
P.s.
When your are looking for a translation into another language, pay attention to the logo, part of the domain is implemented in it as a list of languages, click and change. I understand that this is not obvious and affects usability, but I like it this way more!
